My side project while studying programming

The goal is a functional chess game with good UI and all rules accounted for.


Things that need to be implemented/fixed:
  * make the king not able to expose himself to a check
  * En passant for pawns
  * castling for king & rook
  * need to bugtest 

Thinking about adding eventually: 
  * ability to select 1 square first then the second
  * preview of legal moves for selected square
  * arrow keys controlled square selector
